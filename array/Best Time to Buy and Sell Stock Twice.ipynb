    "## Approach 2: Dynamic programming\n",
    "\n",
    "In dynamic programming algorithms, normally we create an array of one or two dimensions to keep the intermediate optimal results. In this problem though, we would use two arrays, with one array keeping the results of sequence from left to right and the other array keeping the results of sequence from right to left.\n",
