    "# Advance Through an Array\n",
    "\n",
    "In a particular board game, a player has to advance through a sequence of positions. Each positions has a nonnegative integer associated with it, representing the maximum you can advance from that osition in one move. You begin at the first position, and win by getting to the last position.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let A = [3, 3, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1] represent the board game, i.e., the ith entry in A is the maximum we an advance from i, Then the game can be won by the following sequence of teh advances through A: A[0] (3) → A[1] (3) → A[4] (2) → A[6]\n",
    "\n",
    "If A was [3, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1], it would not possible to advance past position A[0] (3) so the game cannot be won. This is because A[0] (3) → A[1] (2) → 0, A[0] (3) → A[2] (0) → 0 and A[0] (3) → A[3] (0) → 0.\n",

    "## Solution: Furthest to go at each index\n",
    "\n",
    "It is natrual to try advancing as far as possible in each step. This approach does not always work, because it potentially skips indices containing large entries. For example, if A = [2, 4, 1, 1, 0, 2, 3], advancing from A[0] furthest 2 steps goes to A[2] (1) → A[3] (1) → A[4] (0), after which it cannot progress. However, advancing to index 1, which contains a 4 lets us proceed to index 5, from which we can advance to index 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example suggests iterating through ::all entries:: in A. As we iterate through the array, we track the furthest index we know we can advance to, which is the max of the furthest index to reach at index i-1, and i + A[i].\n",
