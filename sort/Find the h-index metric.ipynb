    "# Find the h-index Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "The h-index is a metric that measures both the productivity and citation impact of a researcher. Specifically, a research’s h-index is the largest number `h` such that the research has published `h` pages that have each been cited at least `h` times.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if Carl has published papers A, B, C, D, which have been cited 3, 1, 4, 1 time, respectively, then his h-index is `2` (corresponding to the pagers A, C).\n",

Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between the maximum and minimum keys, so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where the variation in keys is not significantly greater than the number of items.\n",
